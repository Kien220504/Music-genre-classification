# Music-genre-classification
Classify music genre using Machine Learning Deep Learning

Disclaimer: This project is just a final project of the subject "Python for Datascience" at my university, consist of 4 people.
## Introduction
This project focuses on classifying music into different genres using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. It utilizes audio feature extraction methods and various classification models to achieve accurate genre predictions.
## Features
- Audio feature extraction using MFCCs, Chroma, Spectral Contrast, etc.
- Supervised learning with ML model: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting).
- Deep Learning approach using CNN.
- Dataset preprocessing including noise reduction, normalization, and augmentation.
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Visualization of audio features and model performance.

## Dataset
The project uses the **GTZAN dataset**, which contains 10 genres with 1,000 audio files (30s each). Other datasets can also be integrated.
